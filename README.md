# breast-detection/classification-system

# Installation
* cd into folder
* sudo pip3 install pipenv
* pipenv shell
* pipenv install

- After Installation run the following commands
- python3.7 run.py or python3.7 run.py createdb (if database.db deleted)
- The app uses a pretrained model. The model if deleted then start by running "python train.py"

# password
* username: "doc@doc.com"
* password: "doctor"

# Objectives
* The app should have the following :
    * New patients should be able to create an account
    *  They should be able to login into their account
    *  Patients must submit a scan of type image for classification and diagnosis
    *  The system should only accept images. NB: We assume the patients knows the purpose of the system hence no way no validate the images for now
* The app should be able to generate results viz
    * Benign (Not cancerous) 
    * Malignant (Cancerous)
* Produce reports

# Tools and Frameworks Used
* Python 3.7 programming language
* Flask python web framework
* Scikit-Learn (Python ML library)
* Keras (ML and Deep learning python library)

# TODO 
## Create a model to test the following facts

The following are some of the known risk factors for breast cancer. However, most cases of breast cancer cannot be linked to a specific cause. Talk to your doctor about your specific risk.

Age. The chance of getting breast cancer increases as women age. Nearly 80 percent of breast cancers are found in women over the age of 50.

Personal history of breast cancer. A woman who has had breast cancer in one breast is at an increased risk of developing cancer in her other breast.

Family history of breast cancer. A woman has a higher risk of breast cancer if her mother, sister or daughter had breast cancer, especially at a young age (before 40). Having other relatives with breast cancer may also raise the risk.

Genetic factors. Women with certain genetic mutations, including changes to the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, are at higher risk of developing breast cancer during their lifetime. Other gene changes may raise breast cancer risk as well.

Childbearing and menstrual history. The older a woman is when she has her first child, the greater her risk of breast cancer. Also at higher risk are:

    Women who menstruate for the first time at an early age (before 12)
    Women who go through menopause late (after age 55)
    Women whoâ€™ve never had children
